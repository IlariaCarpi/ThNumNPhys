# Variational Monte Carlo

## Overview and Project Objectives

In this project, the variational Monte Carlo method is used in order to find the ground states energies of a 1D harmonic oscillator and a He4 nucleus. For each system, the idea is to start from an ansatz for the wave function (trial wave function) and vary the parameters using the Monte Carlo integration to calculate the energy. To vary the parameters we perform a random walk, and each set of parameters is evaluated using the Metropolis algorithm.
